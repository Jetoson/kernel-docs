If this is the first time you are building a kernel on your system, you will
need to [set up the build environment](#set-up-build-environment) and
[install the required packages](#install-required-packages).

Otherwise, skip ahead to
[Obtain the source for an Ubuntu release](#obtain-the-source-for-an-ubuntu-release).
